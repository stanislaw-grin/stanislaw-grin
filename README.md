Product-oriented Full Stack Developer with over 10 years of experience delivering web applications, platforms, and internal tools. Known for transforming ideas into scalable solutions that prioritize real user needs, clean architecture, and long-term maintainability.

⚡️ **Life & Hobbies**

Outside of work, I actively play electric guitar 🎸, constantly honing my skills and experimenting with guitar effect pedals 🎛️ to craft my signature tone. I also collect vinyl records 🎶 — a way to connect deeply with music and keep the creative spark alive.
